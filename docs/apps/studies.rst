Studies
=====================================


When using Signalbox, distinguish between a Trial or Research Project (i.e. the work you are doing) and a :class:`Study`.  In Signalbox, studies have a specific meaning, and a complex trial may be split across several studies for convenience and simplicity.

To get a grip on how things are structured, see the :doc:`/overview`.
