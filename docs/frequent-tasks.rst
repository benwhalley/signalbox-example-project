Notes on adding participants to studies
~~~~~~

- ``Email`` address is a required field, but if no participant email is availble it's recommended to include the experimenter's or a study-specific email here.

- ``Site`` refers to the treatment center the participant is attached to in multicenter trials. The site-specific settings (see :doc:`site-specific-settings`) can be adjusted to make this field optional.
