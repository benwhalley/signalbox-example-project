Creating and editing a public facing website
=============================================

Alongside Signalbox, we use a content management system to create pages which are visible on the 'front end' or public facing website.

You can see a list of these pages as `</admin/cms/page/>`_. In addition, once you have logged in, you can press the + icon in the top right hand corner of most pages to edit the content on them. The icon looks like this:

.. image:: /images/edit_button.png


Clicking it brings up an editing toolbar like this:

.. image:: /images/editbar.png

From which you can turn on editing, and also access the admin site. Once you have turned edit mode on, roll over content and click the edit icon shown in the image below:

.. image:: /images/placeholder1.png

When adding content to the website, you can use markdown syntax to style content (see :doc:`markdown` for more details).



Secured pages
=============

Additional functionality has been added to the CMS app to enable some pages to be protected from public view. These pages are only accessible by the study team (i.e. researchers, research assistants, assessors, and clinicians).

To make a page on the website protected, use the edit bar to access the page settings:

.. image:: /images/pagesets.png

Scroll to the bottom of this page and click the 'advanced settings link'. Then enable the 'login required' checkbox, and save the page.

Protecting a page which has sub-pages (i.e. child pages which appear lower than it in the hierarchy of pages) will make all sub-pages protected.

.. warning:: If in doubt CHECK! Logout of your account and make sure the page really is protected.

.. warning:: Although protected from public view, the website is NOT to be used for sensitive content (e.g. correspondence, risk reports etc).
